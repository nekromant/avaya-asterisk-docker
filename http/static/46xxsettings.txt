## IMPORTANT: It is recommended to use the 46xxsettings.txt file as reference for 
##            configuration of relevant parameters and avoid the use of the whole file 
##            as it is. This in order to reduce the file size, network traffic and 
##            time required for downloading and parsing of this file by the endpoints.

######################################################################################
##
## Any line that does not begin with "SET ", "IF ", "GOTO ", "# " or "GET " is treated as a comment.
## To activate a setting, remove the "## " from the beginning of the line for that parameter so
## that the line begins with "SET ", and change the value to one appropriate for your environment.
##
## To include spaces in a value, the entire value must be enclosed in double quotes, as in:                                               
## SET MYCERTCN "Avaya telephone with MAC address $MACADDR" 
## Double quotes (" ASCII 34) shall only be used. Left double quotation mark (� ASCI 8220) and right double quotation mark (� ASCII 8221) 
## shall NOT be used.

## Note: Avaya Vantage Connect Application (as well to any other Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK based application) running
## on Avaya Vantage Devices retrieves this configuration file after testable parameters 
## (such as $GROUP, $MODEL4, $MODEL4, $IPADD, $MACADDR and $SUBNET) were analyzed 
## by Avaya Vantage Devices. Therefore, any configuration assigned to specific GROUP, etc. will be provided to the 
## Avaya Vantage Devices belong to this GROUP, etc. and to the Android Avaya Breeze client SDK based application running on them.
## In R3.0.0.0 and later, there is also support for $MODEL6 and $GEN as testable parameters. $GEN equal to "B" used by Avaya Vantage Devices
## running R3.0.0.0 and later. 
##
## Note: Avaya Vantage Connect Application (as well to any other Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK based application) can use
## any configuration parameter defined in this file or even use their own NEW parameters configured
## in such file. It is the application responsibility to extract these parameters from the configuration
## file that Avaya Vantage Devices generates for the application. Only Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK Based application
## can access the configuration file generated by the Avaya Vantage Device according to 
## ACTIVE_CSDK_BASED_PHONE_APP configuration parameter. The configuration file generated by the Avaya Vantage devices for 
## the Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK based application includes analyzed version of this file, then configuration received 
## from Avaya Aura Device Services(if enabled) and then specific configurations parameters received from other sources such 
## as DHCP/LLDP/PPM/UI.
##
## Note for Avaya Vantage device and Avaya Vantage Connect Application (as well to any other Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK based application):
## Any parameter configured using this file can also be configured in Avaya Aura Device Services. AADS has higher precedence compare to this file
## download from HTTP/S file server.
##
## Note: Avaya Breeze Client SDK applications (e.g. Avaya IX Workplace, Avaya Vantage Connect, etc.) keep their previous configuration parameters values even if not explicitly configured in this file. 
##  The value is not returned to default when the parameter is removed or masked as on Avaya SIP hard endpoints (96x1/J100/Avaya Vantage). To return to default, the parameter shall be explicitly configured with "".
## 
## Avaya Vantage Open application retrieves all its configuration from the Avaya MPS server. All Avaya Vantage configuration parameters are 
## applicable when Avaya Vantage Open application is used unless explicitly stated otherwise below. 
## Avaya Vantage open is NOT based on Avaya Breeze Client SDK.

##        1. Priority-tagged and untagged frames from the network port will be forwarded to the PC port only when VLANSEP==1,
##           H1xx sends tagged packets (L2Q==0 or 1 and VLANTEST==0 or timer < VLANTEST) and L2QVLAN<>0, else to both phone and PC ports.
##        2. No enforcement of PHY2VLAN and PHY2PRIO on tagged VLAN packets received from PC port. If VLANSEP==1,
##           H1xx sends tagged packets (L2Q==0 or 1 and VLANTEST==0 or timer < VLANTEST) and 0<>PHY2VLAN<>L2QVLAN<>0 then:
##           a. Untagged packets from PC port will be tagged with PHY2VLAN and priority==0. 
##           b. Tagged packets will be forwarded as tagged packets only if their VLAN equal to PHY2VLAN. 
##              Otherwise the packets from PC will be sent unmodified.
##           Only in case of VLANSEP==1,H1xx sends tagged packets (L2Q==0 or 1 and VLANTEST==0 or timer < VLANTEST) and 0<>PHY2VLAN<>L2QVLAN<>0, 
##           there will be full separation between PC and phone traffic. In all other cases, PC traffic can reach the phone.
##        3. When VLANSEP ==0, H1xx sends untagged packets even if L2Q==0 or 1 and VLANTEST==0 or timer < VLANTEST.

## SET VLANSEP 0
##
## VLANSEPMODE specifies whether full VLAN separation will be enabled by the built-in Ethernet switch
##  while the telephone is tagging frames with a non-zero VLAN ID. This VLAN separation is enabled when:
##  VLANSEP=1, L2QVLAN<> PHY2VLAN (and both has value different than 0), L2Q is auto (0) or (1)  tagging. 
##  In this new VLAN separation scheme:
##  - Untagged packets from PC port will be forwarded to network port only as untagged packets.
##  - Tagged packets from PC port will be forwarded to network port only as tagged packets only in case 
##    their VLAN is equal to PHY2VLAN. 
##    In this mode, tagged and untagged packets from  PC port will never reach phone's port. 
##  - Untagged packets from the network will be sent to the PC port only.
##  - Tagged packets from the network port will be sent to the PC port if their VLAN is equal to PHY2VLAN 
##    and to the phone if their VLAN is equal to L2QVLAN. 
##  - 802.1x/LLDP and Spanning tree packets are supported as in previous releases in this new mode.
##  When VLANSEPMODE is 0, then the VLAN separation is based on previous releases where untagged packets 
##  from PC port can reach the phone.

## Description
##     This parameter replaces SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST for dual mode phones. It is used on IPv6-only phones to provide the list of SIPv6 servers. 
##     SIPv4 servers are ignored in IPv6-only mode. It is used to select the registration address. 
##     The list has the following format: host[:port][;transport=xxx]
##     where:
##         - host: is an IP addresses in dotted-decimal format or hex format
##         - port: is the optional port number. If a port number is not specified the default 
##                 value (5060 for TCP, 5061 for TLS) will be used
##         - transport: is the optional transport type (where xxx is tls or tcp)  
##                      If a transport type is not specified the default value TLS will be used
##     A dual mode controller has addresses of both families within curly brackets.
##     A settings file example is:
##           SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2 "{[2007:7::5054:ff:fe35:c6e]:5060;transport=tcp,47.11.15.142:5060;transport=tcp},

##     Dual mode phones use SIGNALING_ADDR_MODE to select SM IP addresses from SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2. 
##     If SIGNALING_ADDR_MODE is 4, register to the first IPv4 address in SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2.
##     IPv4 only phones use SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST. Dual mode phones use SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST if SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2 is not provided.
##     SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2 should only be used if IPv6 addresses (FQDN is not supported) may be used for SIP signaling.
##     SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2 should not be used if FQDN (DNS name format) is used for sip controllers.

##         - If Forced is set for an occupied key location, it overrides the existing key or moves it to a different location.
##         - If Forced is not set and the location is empty, the new definition for this location is applied.
##         - If Forced is not set and the location is already occupied, the new definition is dropped.
##         - If Forced is not set and the location is empty but this key type is already configured for a different location, the new definition is dropped.

##
## WIFISTAT specifies whether the user is given an option to enable Wi-Fi.
##  Value  Operation
##    0    Wi-Fi is disabled and the user is not given an option to enable it; the phone will only use the Ethernet interface.
##    1    The user is given an option to enable Wi-Fi; the phone will connect to Ethernet (Default), unless the UI is used to manually switch to Wi-Fi.
##    2    Wi-Fi is the preferred interface, but manual override to a different SSID or to Ethernet is allowed; the phone will connect to WLAN_ESSID (i.e., the pre-configured Wi-Fi
##          network) unless the phone UI is used to manually switch to another SSID or to Ethernet. Associated pre-configured Wi-Fi network security parameters must also be specified.
##  This parameter is supported by:
##       J100 SIP R2.0.0.0 and later, J159 SIP R4.0.3.0 and later, J189 SIP R4.0.6.1 and later; values 0-2 are supported.
##         Only J129 and J179 support a pluggable Wi-Fi/BT module (J139/J169 does not support Wi-Fi/BT). If the phone does not support Wi-Fi/BT, WIFISTAT will be internally set
##         to 0, regardless of the value received from 46xxsettings.txt.
##         The Administrator should always test a new settings file configuration on a single phone before committing it to several phones, as a configuration error (such as
##         specifying an incorrect WLAN_ESSID or Wi-Fi security settings) will cause phones to become disconnected from the network, necessitating manual correction on each
##         phone's local User Interface, as the phone will not be reachable via any other means.
##         If the phone is using the pre-configured network (i.e., Ethernet or a specific Wi-Fi WLAN_ESSID), and then the phone UI is used to manually switch to a different
##         network, the phone will enter Manual Network Configuration Mode, which will cause the phone to continue to connect to the manually-configured network on subsequent
##         reboots, regardless of the pre-configured network specified by WIFISTAT and any associated parameters.
##         There are 2 ways to return the phone to Automatic Network Configuration mode (i.e., to comply again with WIFISTAT, and if WIFISTAT=2, also WLAN_ESSID and
##         associated pre-configured Wi-Fi network security parameters):
##           - Use the phone's UI to explicitly toggle "Network config" from "Manual" to "Auto".
##           - Change WIFISTAT to 0 and reboot the phone, which will force the phone to use Ethernet, after which, WIFISTAT can be changed to the desired value and the phone
##             rebooted again.

## characters. No spaces are allowed inside the string.
## The purpose of this parameter is to support cases where the server certificate Subject Common Name of Subject Alternative Names
## include FQDN (instead of IP address) and the SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST is defined using IP address. The main use case is for Avaya Aura SM/PPM connectivity
## where the SIP controller list returned from Aura (PPM) to the endpoint is IP address only while server certificate is defined with FQDN.
## Internet trusted CAs prefer signing of Internet public server certificates with FQDN only. 
## This parameter is supported with any phone service running over TLS. Though, the main use case if for Avaya Aura SM/PPM services.

## SET OVERRIDE_SOFTKEY_SCA_REMOTE_HELD 1
##
## SOFTKEY_SCA_REMOTE_HELD specifies new custom softkey for SCA/BLA lines in REMOTE HELD state.
##  The default value is "".
##   "Blank" and "Function" are supported as type. When "Function" is used, then the action is: "bargein", "pickup" and "newcall". 
##   Note: Field names ("type", "action", "label") are case insensitive (for example, "action", "ACTION", "Action" are all supported). "type" value - always case insensitive. 
##    "action" value - case insensitive for "function" type actions, case sensitive for "dial" type actions. "label" values  - always case sensitive.
##   Note: "blank" softkeys do not require action or label fields. "Blank" is an empty softkey with no function, which can be used to fill in a location in a softkey set. "Blank" automatically replaces softkeys
##    which are not allowed by either configuration or runtime conditions.
##   Note: When using "ADD SOFTKEY_SCA_REMOTE_HELD" the order of the lines will be used for presentation of softkeys for SCA/BLA lines in REMOTE HELD state. 
##   Note: There is an option to use one single line of "SET" with multiple softkeys. e.g. "SOFTKEY_SCA_REMOTE_HELD "type=function;action=bargein;label=bargein,type=function;action=pickup;label=pickup"  
##   Note: SET keyword overrides the value, while ADD adds content into the end of previous value separated by comma. The first record can be both SET and ADD, but following records must use ADD keyword.
##   Note: For the complete list of type/action, please refer to the administration guide.

##############  SECURE SHELL (SSH) SETTINGS  ###############
##
## Note: The SSH server on the endpoints is used by Avaya Services only for debugging purposes only. 
## The SSH server supports only Avaya Services Logins ("craft" and "sroot").
## By enabling Avaya Services Logins you are granting Avaya access to your endpoints.
## This is necessary required to maximize the performance and value of your Avaya
## support entitlements, allowing Avaya to resolve product issues in a timely manner.
## In addition to enabling the Avaya Logins, the Avaya Product that the endpoints register with must be registered 
## using the Avaya Global Registration Tool (GRT, see https://grt.avaya.com) to be eligible for Avaya remote connectivity. 
## Please see the Avaya support site (support.avaya.com/registration) for additional information for registering products 
## and establishing remote access and alarming.
## By disabling Avaya Services Logins you are preventing Avaya access to
## your endpoints. This is not recommended, as it can impacts Avaya's ability to provide
## support for the product. Unless the customer is well versed in managing the product
## themselves, Avaya Services Logins should not be disabled.
## The access to the SSH server is protected by ASG (Legacy authentication algorithm) 
## or EASG (new authentication algorithm). Enhanced Access Security Gateway (EASG) provides a more secure authentication 
## compared to ASG for SSH server access. Endpoints that support EASG are no longer support ASG.

##   is not null (TRUSTCERTS <>"" and at least one trusted certificate was downloaded successfully). The root certificate of the CA which used to sign the HTTPS file server identity certificate 
##   MUST be in the trusted certificate repository. "AUTH" can be set to 1 only when HTTPS is used to download the configuration file. 
##   The only way to return AUTH parameter to 0 on J100/96x1 SIP endpoints is by doing CLEAR operation (which requires knowledge of administrator password).

## SET NVVPNUSER AvayaPhone$SERIALNO
##
## NVVPNPSWDTYPE
## Valid Values
##    1  Save in Flash.
##    2  Erase on reset.
##    3  Numeric One Time Password.
##    4  Alpha-Numeric One Time Password.
##    5  Erase on VPN Termination
## Description
##    This variables determines how password should be treated. By default 
##    password type is set to 1. You must set this variable to 3 or 4 if
##    using One Time Password such as SecureID from RSA. 
## Note 
##    Setting password type to 3 will not let the user select "Alpahbets" 
##    while entering password. This might look like an obvious choice when
##    using RSA secure ID tokens. However under some conditions user may 
##    need to respond back by entering 'y' or 'n' in the password field.
##    This could happen if RSA ACE server is configured to generate PIN 
##    instead of letting the user select a PIN.
## Example : Setting password type to 2 (Erase on reset)
## SET NVVPNPSWDTYPE 1
##
## NVVPNCOPYTOS
## Valid Values
##    1  YES
##    2  NO
## Description 
##    Value of this variable decides whether TOS bits should be copied from
##    inner header to outer header or not. If it's value is 1, TOS bits are
##    copied otherwise not. By default TOS bits are not copied from inner
##    header to outer header. Some Internet Service Provider don't route the
##    IP packets properly if TOS bits are set to anything other than 0.
## Example
##    SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 1
## Note
##    It is highly recommended that this value should not be changed if phone
##    is downloading the script over the VPN tunnel in order to avoid 
##    overriding end user setting due to ISP specific issues. For example you
##    can set this value to 1 while provisioning phone with VPN firmware so 
##    that phone can take advantage of QOS service provided by home router but
##    if the phone's ISP (Few percent cases) does not handle properly the 
##    packets with non-zero TOS bits in IP header, phone user will have to
##    revert back this value to 2. Under such circumstances it is desirable
##    the user's choice don't get overridden every time script is downloaded.
## Example: Setting NVVPNCOPYTOS to 1 if script is not downloaded over VPN tunnel.
##    IF $VPNACTIVE SEQ 1 GOTO skipcopytos
##    SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 1
##    # skipcopytos
## SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 2
##
## NVVPNENCAPS
## Valid Values
##    0  4500-4500
##    1  Disable
##    2  2070-500
##    4  RFC (As per RFC 3947 and 3948)
## Description
##    Type of UDP encapsulation method to use if there is a NAT device between
##    phone and the security gateway. By default UDP Encapsulation 4500-4500
##    is used. 
##    If NVVPNENCAPS is 0, IKE negotiation starts with source port of 2070
##       and destination port 500. Negotiation switches to port source port
##       4500 and destination port 4500 if peer supports port floating (Ref 
##       RFC 3947,3948). Finally IPsec traffic is send inside UDP packets 
##       from/to port 4500 if supported by peer or port 2070<->500 if port
##       floating is not supported but UDP encapsulation is supported as 
##       published in the initial draft versions of RFC 3947 and 3948.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 1, IKE NAT traversal is completely disabled.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 2, Port floating is disabled during IKE nat traversal.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 4, IKE negotiation starts with source port of 500 and
##       destination port 500. Negotiation switches to port source port 4500
##       and destination port 4500 if peer supports port floating (Ref RFC 3947
##       and 3948). Finally IPsec traffic is send inside UDP packets from/to 
##       port 4500 if supported by peer or port 500<->500 if port floating is 
##       not supported but UDP encapsulation is supported as published in the
##       initial draft versions of RFC 3947 and 3948.
## Note
##    UDP Encapsulation causes overhead hence it might be desirable to disable
##    UDP Encapsulation if NAT device supports IPsec pass through and there is
##    only one IPsec client behind the NAT connecting to the same security 
##    gateway. However not all devices support IPsec pass through hence this
##    value must not be pushed if phone is downloading the script over the VPN tunnel.
## Example : Setting NVVPNENCAPS to 1 if script is not downloaded over VPN tunnel.
##
##          IF $VPNACTIVE SEQ 1 goto skipencaps
##          SET NVVPNENCAPS 1
##          # skipencaps
##
## The example above will set NVVPNENCAPS to 1 if script is not downloaded over the tunnel.
## SET NVVPNENCAPS 0
##
## NVIKEPSK
## Valid Values
##    String. Length of the string cannot exceed 30 characters.
## Description
##    Preshared Key to use during phase 1 negotiation.
## Note 
##    It is recommeneded that user enter his/her Preshared Key using phone's 
##    dialpad. However if you don't want to share PSK with the end user 
##    because it's common for multiple users you can use this variable to 
##    push PSK (Group password) to each phone and the end user will never
##    know what the PSK is. But if you are doing this, make sure that the file 
##    server is on an isolated network and is used only for provisioning
##    VPN parameters to the phones.
## Example : Setting abc1234 as Preshared Key
## SET NVIKEPSK abc1234
##
## NVIKEID
## Valid Values 
##     String. Length of the string cannot exceed 30 characters.
## Description
##     Phone uses this string as IKE Identifier during phase 1 negotiation. 
##     Some XAuth documentation refer to this variable as group name because 
##     same IKE Id is shared among a group of user and individual user 
##     authentication is done using XAuth after establishing IKE phase 1 
##     security association.
##  The default value is "VPNPHONE".
## SET NVIKEID phones@sales.com
##
## NVIKEIDTYPE
## Valid Values
##    1    IP Address
##    2    FQDN
##    3    User-FQDN (E-Mail)
##    9    Directory-Name
##    11   KEY-ID (Opaque)
## Description
##    Phone uses this variable as the IKE Identifier type for the 
##    IKE-ID specified via NVIKEID variable.
## Note
##    This variable default value depends on the value of variable NVVPNCFGPROF.
## SET NVIKEIDTYPE 2
##
## NVIPSECSUBNET
## Valid Values
##     Comma separated list of strings containing subnet and masks. Number of
##     strings cannot exceed 5.
## Description
##     This variable contains IP subnets protected by the security gateway.
##     By default phone assumes that all the network resources are behind 
##     the security gateway hence it negotiates for a security association
##     between it's IP address (or Virtual IP if delivered via IKE Config 
##     mode) and 0.0.0.0 with the security gateway. If your security gateway
##     is configured to allow building security association for only selected
##     subnets, you can specify them here.
## Example : 
##     Configuring 10.1.12.0/24 and 172.16.0.0/16 as the subnets protected by
##     the Security Gateway
##     SET NVIPSECSUBNET 10.1.12.0/24,172.16.0.0/16
## SET NVIPSECSUBNET 0.0.0.0/0
##
## NVIKEDHGRP specifies the number of the DH group to use during IKE phase 1 negotiation.

##     In general, if dual-stack operation is enabled, whether IPv4 or IPv6
##     is to be used to contact a server is determined by the value of the 
##     parameter that contains the server address(es). However, if the value
##     is a DNS name and if DNS returns both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, 
##     the order in which they will be tried will be based on the order in

##       2. Whether an IPv4 or IPv6 addresses returned by DNS would be tried first during dual-mode operation.
## DHCP clients use DUAL_IPPREF to decide which SSON configuration attributes to apply for DHCPv4/DHCPv6 interworking in dual mode. Based on DUAL_IPPREF the phone selects SSON attributes either from DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 server.
##     If DNS server name is provided, and if DNS resolver returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, the order in which they will be tried will be based on DUAL_IPPREF parameter.
## NOTE: SIP server FQDNs are resolved into addresses that are ordered based on SIGNALING_ADDR_MODE, not DUAL_IPPREF
## Example: Setting preference to IPv6
## SET DUAL_IPPREF 6
##  This parameter is supported by:
##       Avaya Vantage Devices SIP R2.2.0.0 and later; Only the selection of SSON either from DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 server is supported (item 1 above).

## Conference transfer on primary appearance
##  When CONF_TRANS_ON_PRIMARY_APPR is set to 1, 
##  conference and transfer setup will first attempt 
##  to use an idle primary call appearance even if 
##  initiated from a bridged call appearance.  
##  If an idle primary call appearance is not available, 
##  then an idle bridged call appearance will be used.  
##  Conference and transfer setup initiated from a bridged call 
##  appearance when no idle primary call appearance is available 
##  will next attempt to use an idle bridged call appearance of 
##  the same extension and if not available, an idle bridged call 
##  appearance of a different extension.
##  Note:  When CONF_TRANS_ON_PRIMARY_APPR is set to 1, AUTO_SELECT_ANY_IDLE_APPR is ignored.
##
##  When CONF_TRANS_ON_PRIMARY_APPR is set to 0,

##  If an idle primary call appearance is not available, it will use an idle 
##  bridged call appearance regardless of the setting of AUTO_SELECT_ANY_IDLE_APPR.
##  Conference and transfer setup initiated from a bridged call appearance will attempt
##  to use an idle bridged call appearance of the same extension.  
##  If an idle bridged call appearance of the same extension is not available 
##  and AUTO_SELECT_ANY_IDLE_APPR is set to 1, then conference and transfer 
##  setup will use any idle call appearance (primary or bridged).  
##  It will first attempt to find an idle primary call appearance and if not 
##  available will then attempt to find an idle bridged call appearance of a different extension.
##  However, if AUTO_SELECT_ANY_IDLE_APPR is set to 0, transfer and conference setup
##  initiated on a bridged call appearance will be denied if an idle bridged call appearance
##  of the same extension is not available.

## Dynamic Feature Set Discovery
##  If the DISCOVER_AVAYA_ENVIRONMENT parameter value is 1, the phone discovers (determines) 
##  if that controller supports the AST feature set or not. The phone will send a SUBSCRIBE 
##  request to the active controller for the Feature Status Event Package (avaya-cm-feature-status).
##  If the request succeeds, then the phone proceeds with PPM Synchronization.
##  If the request is rejected, is proxied back to the phone or does not receive a response, 
##  the phone will assume that AST features are not available.
##  If the parameter value is 0, the phone operates in a mode where AST features are not available.
